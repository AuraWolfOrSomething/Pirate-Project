This uses support exp number 5 to store the damage taken. Because I was told this hack doesn't use supports, this should be fine. Even if it does, using slot number 5 (the 6th because it starts at 0) means there is still 5 slots remaining before it that can still be used.
This byte should be saved.

When the units gets hit multiple times before dealing damage, maximum damage taken is considered (not last, not sum).

This introduces two proc loop modules:

- EyeForAnEyeProcApply, which is what adds the damage bonus.
- EyeForAnEyeProcSave, which saves the damage taken for being added later. This should probably be last.

I would have hacked BattleGenerateHitEffects instead for the save part but Break breaks(lol) any hooks into it by replacing the function entirely.

I had to hack the UpdateUnitFromBattle hook by the Equip hack to save back the support_exp[5] field. This is very hacky (see there). If no such hook is done, the saved damage will not persist between combats.
