# Break
 What it looks like on the tin, Engage’s Break mechanic. 
 Credit to Pikmin1211 for the base of this, the Aftershock skill from Bells of Byelen.
 To install, simply #include Installer.event wherever in your buildfile.
 It requires Skillsys’s debuff table to function, so make sure you’re using Skillsys.
 You can set characters/classes that are exempt to Break in the respective lists in Installer.event,
 along with specific matchups in the BreakTargetTable.
 It hooks into various vanilla functions to account for Break,
 so it may conflict with other hacks in some areas.
