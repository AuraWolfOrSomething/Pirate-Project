Hub A - Port Greagor[X]

//Hub A of Pirate Project
//Scenario: The crew arrives in Port Greagor and heads to port to sell the boat (first go-around). Various events occur in Port Greagor, and Hermenegildo/Estelle join you in the first run through the hub. Second and afterwards ones don't have the initial scene and just have hub events, changing every two chapters.


//Scene 1
//Lua and the crew sail towards their destination, and as they get close, Lua, Desiderio, and Pilar discuss the details of selling their new ship.
//Desiderio and Pilar "cleaned" the ship by getting rid of the Blackhearts so that they could sell it; Lua is mildly displeased but accepts Desiderio's logic.
//Lua brings up the possibility of keeping it for their fleet on their growing crew, but denies it due to the vessel being too wide for quick travel.
//Desiderio says that they need a name for the crew before even considering that, to which Lua is noncommited, blaming her lack of creativity.
//The group splits: Pilar and Desiderio take the Blackheart ship and head to port to sell it, while Lua and the rest head back to the crew's hideout.

//Scene 2
//Lua docks the boat, and Razvan thanks the Maker that they finally made it back. Lua asks if he wants her to accompany him into town and purchase anything,
//but he says no, wanting to be nowhere near such a gathering of pirates. The two are greeted by Hermenegildo, another novice of the crew who was saved by
//Lua from a life of servitude to a different pirate crew (who saved him from starvation when he was stranded). Lua thanks him for keeping an eye on the base,
//saying that his debt to her has been reduced: she paid to free him from those pirates, after realizing he was a well-learned individual that she could use.
//Hermenegildo pleads Lua for a tome he can use, to which Lua replies that she'll purchase one for him if he's willing to increase his debt: he relents.
//Razvan asks Hermenegildo if he can teach him some of his tome knowledge, as he wants to learn how to defend himself, and Lua offers to decrease Hermenegildo's
//debt if he does: The scholar agrees immediately, and the two set off for the hideout's library. Lua makes for port, wanting to check on the boat's sale.

[FR][LoadRazvan]
[ML]Ho, Lua! Let me bend your[N]
ear a wee bit longer.[AN]
[R]Let me guess. Need me to pay[N]
off your tab again, old man?[AN]
Last I checked, my coffers were[N]
as empty as your guild's soul.[AN]
[FR]Captain Lua, please don't[N]
antagonize Master MENTOR![AN]
It's a miracle he hasn't sold us[N]
out to the empire for a bounty.[AN]
[ML]What breed of man do you think me, boy?[AN]
A true man - a true merchant - has a[N]
sense of honor and dignity![AN]
I'd never sell your crew up the river[N]
for such a paltry pittance of gold.[AN]
[R]What he means is that we make him more[N]
gold than he'd get from turning us in.[AN]
[ML]You wound me, Lua![A] But, as it happens,[N]
I have a job for you and your crew.[AN]
[FR]What task would you have us perform, sir?[AN]
[ML]You two've heard of the Merchant's Fair?[AN]
It's an annual event hosted by the guild[N]
where merchants auction for rare relics.[AN]
[R]I remember you bringing me to a few of[N]
those back when I was your apprentice.[AN]
If you ask me, all that gold flaunted[N]
around is just the nobles overcomp-[N]
[FR]Uh- the job, Master MENTOR![N]
What do you want us to do?[AN]
[3LB]
[ML]Well, to the surprise of us all,[N]
some of the relics up for auction[N]
were aquired... under the counter.[AN]
[2LB]
[FR]I'm sorry, what do you mean?[AN]
[R]He means the nobles don't own the relics.[AN]
Whenever the empire orders a raid on an[N]
island accused of sheltering rebels,[AN]
the nobles swoop in afterward to loot[N]
it like the hyenas they are.[AN]
[ML]Precisely. Now, I made a deal with the[N]
chieftain of one such outskirt island.[AN]
For a lifetime supply of their lambanog,[N]
I'll get their relic back for them.[AN]
And you'll be the ones to break into[N]
the guardhouse to recover it.[AN]
[R]Great, so you've already signed[N]
us for a job we didn't accept.[AN]
[FR]I think we should take[N]
the job, Captain Lua.[AN]
It's not like it's any different[N]
from our usual work.[A][X]

[ML][LoadMentor]
[R][LoadLua]
[FR][LoadRazvan]
[R]Should I accept MENTOR's job for us?[AN]
[No][X]

## HubA1Accepted
[ML][LoadMentor]
[R][LoadLua]
[FR][LoadRazvan]
[R]Alright, you win. I accept.[AN]
[ML]Wonderful! In that case, here's the[N]
key to the auction guardhouse.[AN]
At nightfall, unlock the back[N]
door and await further orders.[AN]
An islander shaman will arrive to[N]
fill you in on the fine details.[AN]
See you all in two ripples of[N]
the tide![AN][ClearFace]
[FR]Doesn't it feel nice to do the[N]
right thing, Captain Lua?[AN]
[R]Not when there's nothing in it for us.[AN]
Let's make this job worth it, Razvan.[A][X]

## HubA6Pitch
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadRochefort]
[MR]
Excuse me, madam, would you happen[N]
to be Captain Lua?[AN]
[1LB][ML]
That I am, and you are?[AN]
[3LB][MR]
I am Rochefort, a merchant by trade.[AN]
Rumor has it your crew is looking for[N]
work, and it just so happens that I've[N]
been looking for some hired muscle.[AN]
[1LB][ML]
I'm listening. But we don't come cheap.[AN]
[3LB][MR]
Oh, I wouldn't dream of underpaying.[N]
I'll offer 5,000 gold for your troubles.[AN]
You see, I hired another crew to deliver[N]
a shipment of spices to a buyer in the[N]
inner empire, but they swindled me![AN]
The scoundrels must have thought they[N]
could profit more by selling the goods[N]
themselves than delivering them.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
So you want us to retrieve[N]
this shipment for you?[AN]
[3LB][MR]
Precisely! I'll tag along, of course,[N]
in order to inspect the goods.[AN]
I imagine they'll put up some resistance,[N]
but your crew looks rather accustomed[N]
to violence.[AN]
I know the location of their hideout,[N]
and there shouldn't be more than[N]
a dozen or so of them there.[AN]
Nothing you can't handle, I'm sure.[AN]
My bodyguard, Suzanne, will accompany[N]
us as well. She's a bit of a hothead,[N]
but dependable in a fight.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
A tempting offer. Let me think a[N]
little more and get back to you.[AN]
[MR]
Very well, but please keep in mind[N]
this is a time-sensitive matter.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[3LB][ML]
This job may be just what we need,[N]
but I can't shake the feeling that[N]
Rochefort's hiding something.[AN]
He certainly doesn't seem from around[N]
here, but if he's a merchant of good[N]
repute I ought to recognize his name.[AN]
Still, 5,000 gold is a lot of money and[N]
I doubt he'd be foolish enough to try[N]
and double-cross me.[AN]
