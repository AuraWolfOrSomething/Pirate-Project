[FL]Ho, Lua! Let me bend your[N]
ear a wee bit longer.[AN]
[MR]Let me guess. Need me to pay[N]
off your tab again, old man?[AN]
Last I checked, my coffers were[N]
as empty as your guild's soul.[AN]
[FR]Captain Lua, please don't[N]
antagonist Master MENTOR![AN]
It's a miracle he hasn't sold us[N]
out to the empire for a bounty.[AN]
[FL]What breed of man do you think me, boy?[AN]
A true man - a true merchant - has a[N]
sense of honor and dignity![AN]
I'd never sell your crew up the river[N]
for such a paltry pittance of gold.[AN]
[MR]What he means is that we make him more[N]
gold than he'd get from turning us in.[AN]
[FL]You wound me, Lua![A] But, as it happens,[N]
I have a job for you and your crew.[AN]
[FR]What task would you have us perform, sir?[AN]
[FL]You two've heard of the Merchant's Fair?[AN]
It's an annual event hosted by the guide[N]
where merchants auction for rare relics.[AN]
[MR]I remember you bringing me to a few of[N]
those back when I was your apprentice.[AN]
If you ask me, all that gold flaunted[N]
around is just the nobles overcomp-[N]
[FR]Uh- the job, Master MENTOR![N]
What do you want us to do?[AN]
[3LB]
[FL]Well, to the surprise of us all,[N]
some of the relics up for auction[N]
were aquired... under the counter.[AN]
[2LB]
[FR]I'm sorry, what do you mean?[AN]
[MR]He means the nobles don't own the relics.[AN]
Whenever the empire orders a raid on an[N]
island accused of sheltering rebels,[AN]
the nobles swoop in afterward to loot[N]
it like the hyenas they are.[AN]
[FL]Precisely. Now, I made a deal with the[N]
chieftain of one such outskirt island.[AN]
For a lifetime supply of their colada,[N]
I'll get their relic back for them.[AN]
And you'll be the ones to break into[N]
the guardhouse to recover it.[AN]
[MR]Great, so you've already signed[N]
us for a job we didn't accept.[AN]
[FR]I think we should take[N]
the job, Captain Lua.[AN]
It's not like it's any[N]
different from usual work.[AN]
[MR]Should I accept MENTOR's job for us?[AN]
[No][X]
