// Jaime:
// Age: late 20s
// Appearence: same hair color as Carmen, long hair that covers one of his eyes,
// square chin, stubble, aggressive but worried expression, some sort of hat.
// A young rebel. Aggressive and quick to anger, with strong convictions. However,
// he's actually a runaway noble and a relative of Carmen. He's trying to hide this, because
// he doesn't think the rebels will accept him if they knew the truth. Probably have
// him interact with her a few times if she's alive. His real name is Hector del Rian.

// Leonor:
// Age: mid 30s
// Appearence: Muscular, reddish hair, 
// battered clerical garb, some sort of facial scar.
// Originally a laborer for hire, she was attacked by a drunk Imperial soldier
// and became bitter when the Empire wouldn't take action against him. This,
// combined with universally low pay for difficult manual labor, convinced her
// to join the rebellion. Despite lacking magical talent, she was trained as a
// healer, and after a paricularly fatal battle with the Empire in which most of
// the highest-ranking rebel healers were killed, she rose to a leadership position.
// Secretly, she's a bit tired of being a prominent rebel, and is looking for new
// side opportunities so she can disappear for a while.

// Felipe
// Age: early 30s
// Appearence: Dark skin, messy hair, tiny moustache, fancy armor
// An imperial noble who used his social status to become a lieutenant in
// the imperial army. His confidence in his abilities is greater than
// his actual abilities, but he does have somewhat absurd luck.

[MidLeft][2LB]Jaime! You're here![AN]
[MidRight][3LB]Yeah. I hired some pirates to[N]
fight off the Imperials, so[N]
we should be safe.[AN]
