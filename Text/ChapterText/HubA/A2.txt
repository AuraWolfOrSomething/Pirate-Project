// Jaime:
// Age: late 20s
// Appearence: same hair color as Carmen, long hair that covers one of his eyes,
// square chin, stubble, aggressive but worried expression, some sort of hat.
// A young rebel. Aggressive and quick to anger, with strong convictions. However,
// he's actually a runaway noble and a relative of Carmen. He's trying to hide this, because
// he doesn't think the rebels will accept him if they knew the truth. Probably have
// him interact with her a few times if she's alive. His real name is Hector del Rian.

// Leonor:
// Age: mid 30s
// Appearence: Muscular, reddish hair, 
// battered clerical garb, some sort of facial scar.
// Originally a laborer for hire, she was attacked by a drunk Imperial soldier
// and became bitter when the Empire wouldn't take action against him. This,
// combined with universally low pay for difficult manual labor, convinced her
// to join the rebellion. Despite lacking magical talent, she was trained as a
// healer, and after a paricularly fatal battle with the Empire in which most of
// the highest-ranking rebel healers were killed, she rose to a leadership position.
// Secretly, she's a bit tired of being a prominent rebel, and is looking for new
// side opportunities so she can disappear for a while.

// Felipe
// Age: early 30s
// Appearence: Dark skin, messy hair, tiny moustache, fancy armor
// An imperial noble who used his social status to become a lieutenant in
// the imperial army. His confidence in his abilities is greater than
// his actual abilities, but he does have somewhat absurd luck.

// Sierra
// appearence: armor knight girl

// Manfred
// appearence: bandit manfred von karma

[MidLeft][2LB]
Leonor Diaz! Rebel scum! You are surrounded![N]
Surrender now, or be annihilated![AN]
[MidRight]
Annihilated? We can beat you Incendivis[N]
pawns with one hand tied behind our backs![AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmph. I see you're not going to listen to[N]
reason, so you leave me no choice![AN]
[MidLeft][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveFarFarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadRebel][3LB]
Uh[Beat] Boss? It seems like the odds[N]
for us here aren't great. They've got[N]
a Scorpio, they hired the Crimson Hearts[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
If we're captured, we'll be executed at best.[N]
Better to go out fighting, in my opinion.[N]
Plus, if we can take out some of those[AN]
Crimson Heart villains, that'll be a service[N]
to the world. They slaughter and pillage[N]
without mercy wherever they go.[AN]
I just hope Jaime arrives with help in time[Beat][AN]
[X]

## A2PrePrepsCutscene2
[MidLeft][LoadManfred][MidRight][LoadRedFighter]
[MidLeft][2LB]
[Beat]and then I cut his arm off and[N]
said, [OpenQuote]How's that for payin' me tab?"[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Gwah hah hah! That was a great story, boss.[N]
[Beat]Man, I can't believe we're workin' for[N]
the stinkin' empire again. Their jobs are[AN]
always so borin'.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, they pay well, and we're runnin' low on[N]
doubloons. Plus, they gave us permission to[N]
do anything, as long as we complete the job.[AN]
[MidRight][1LB]
Anything, eh? This might be fun[Beat][AN]
[X]

## A2PrePrepsCutscene3
[MidLeft][LoadSierra][MidRight][LoadFelipe]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Felipe[Beat] Are you going to stay close to[N]
me? I'd hate for you to be hurt[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
On the contrary, I'd rather us be apart.[N]
That way, we can attack from both sides,[N]
assuring our victory! A good plan, no?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] It's certainly a plan[Beat][N]
I still insist that you'd be safer with my[N]
protection.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, is one of my soldiers lovestruck?[N]
How cute, but my parents don't approve[N]
of relationships with commoners.[AN]
[TextSpeed][0x1]
I can certainly see how one could fall[N]
in love with my glorious self, however,[N]
given how I have both noble grace and[N]
legendary skill with a spear. It is[N]
sincerely regretful that I must confine[N]
myself to high society for potential[N]
mates, but that is just how it is.[N]
Furthermore, *continuous inane[N]
blathering*[AN]

(Ugh[Beat] How do I get this pompous[N]
idiot to shut up without telling him[N]
I'm his bodyguard[Beat]?)[AN]

Commander Leonor![AN]
[Right][3LB]
Jaime! You came! [Beat]And with what[N]
looks to be a pirate crew? I'd rather[N]
have more reliable rescuers[Beat][AN]
[Left]
Come on! Look, do you want to be saved[N]
or not? These were the only ones[N]
who would take the mission![AN]
[Right]
Well, I still don't trust them.[N]
I suppose that they're better[N]
than getting slaughtered, though.[AN]
[FarLeft]
If you're done insulting me and my crew,[N]
can we hurry up and leave? I'd rather not[N]
fight such a large force if I can avoid it.[AN]
[Left]
Are you serious? With your crew,[AN]
we can strike a serious blow[N]
to the empire and make a getaway[N]
when the tide turns against us![AN]
Not like your ship's going any- LOOK OUT![AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Damn, that's a big hole.[AN]
I didn't expect them to use heavy guns here,[N]
and now there's no way we can fly[N]
with the ship in this state.[AN]
[FarRight][1LB]
Um[Beat] You may not be finished yet.[AN]
[FarLeft][1LB]
What are you on about?[AN]
[FarRight][3LB]
I was a shipbuilder before I joined[N]
the rebels, and I could probably repair[N]
the damage if you can buy enough time.[AN]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Sounds like our only option.[AN]
Everyone, defend the ship until[N]
this man finishes repairing it![AN]
[Right]
Do what she says, boys![N]
We need every blade we can get![AN]
[X]

## A2Village
[MidLeft][LoadVillager][MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][3LB]
What? The Empire's here?[N]
Damn! I hate those scoundrels![N]
I was going to give this scroll[AN]
to the rebel Leonor, so could[N]
you get it to her? I hadn't even[N]
seen her yet[Beat][AN]
[X]

## A2ReinforcementWarning
[MidLeft][LoadFelipe]
[MidLeft][3LB]
It appears our enemies are doing[N]
better than expected[Beat] No matter![N]
We shall charge, and crush them all![AN]
[X]

## A2ReinforcementWarning2
[MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
[MidRight][3LB]
That's the signal taken care of.[N]
Now, even if we're all killed,[N]
they'll still be wiped out by the[AN]
reinforcements. If they have any[N]
sense, they'll retreat[Beat][AN]
[X]

## A2FelipeTurn1
[MidLeft][LoadFelipe]
[MidLeft][3LB]
What? The rebels have gotten[N]
reinforcements? Well, it doesn't matter![N]
We'll just crush them too![AN]
[X]

## A2EndingSoldierGuy
[MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
[MidRight][3LB]
Huh. They killed all of my superiors[N]
already. Well, I guess I'll just give[N]
up on lighting this signal[Beat][AN]
[X]

## A2Ending1
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidLeft][3LB]
[Beat]Well, that takes care of that.[N]
All of the soldiers are retreating, now that[N]
we killed their commanders[Beat] Huh?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadFelipe]
[MidRight][1LB]
Urghh[Beat] What a humiliating loss[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
How are you still alive? Ah, well, we can[N]
fix tha-[....] [Beat]Hey, you look familiar.[N]
Aren't you the son of Count G[รก]lvez?[AN] // I just stole a name from a random spanish noble family
[MidRight][1LB]
M-My father will be furious with you![AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
How did you even get out here? It's well-known[N]
that your family lives about as far away from[N]
here as you can get! Also, why are you a soldier?[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
I distinguished myself with my superior abilities[N]
and was appointed to lead this battalion, obviously.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
[Beat]Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that. Your[N]
father'll pay a good sum to get you back,[N]
that's for sure.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
I won't let you disgrace my name like that![N]
I'll take you down with me! Hyaaargh![AN]
[MidRight][MoveFarFarLeft]
[MidLeft][3LB]
That wasn't even close. I suppose I don't[N]
have to account for all of the cliff-jumping[N]
fools in the world[Beat][AN]
[X]

## A2Ending2
[MidLeft][LoadLua][MidRight][LoadLeonor]
[MidLeft][2LB]
[Beat]Phew, that was a close one.[N]
We completed our mission, though.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hey, thanks for helping me out back[N]
there. I hope we meet again[Beat][AN]
[Left][LoadPilar]
[Left][1LB]
*whispering[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Oh? [Beat]Well, it seems there's been[N]
a change of plans. Looks like I'll be[N]
joining your crew until things calm down.[AN]
The empire's still looking for me, you know.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Thank you. (Pilar, how did you do[N]
that?)[AN]
[X]

## A2Ending2NoLeonor
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidLeft][3LB]
[Beat]Phew, that was a close one.[N]
Unfortunate that we didn't save[N]
the cleric, but at least we survived.[AN]
The rest of the rebels seem to want[N]
to join us, seeing as we saved their[N]
lives, so at least we got something[AN]
out of this.[AN]

[MidRight][1LB]
You look familiar. Have I seen you before?[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
I don't know what you're talking about. I[N]
don't recognize you at all.[AN]
[MidRight][1LB]
[Beat]Wait, aren't you my cou-[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveFarRight][MidRight][MoveFarFarRight]
[FarRight][2LB]
Stop talking! You'll blow my cover![N]
I'm Jaime the normal commoner![AN]

I can tell we'll never beat those[N]
troops. Is this really how it ends[Beat]?[AN]
