It seems we've landed, Lua.[AN]
And no worse for wear,[N]
thanks to this saferoom.[AN]
Storing our essential supplies[N]
here was a prudent decision.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
If it's safe enough for the crew,[N]
it's safe enough for our loot,[N]
right? Still, we got lucky.[AN]
Who'd have thought T.O.R.C.H.[N]
coming after us in Port Greagor[N]
would end up saving our hides?[AN]
[ML]
Hm[Beat] But if we had avoided them,[N]
then Alonso's thugs may not have[N]
forced us to take this risk.[AN]
[MR]
Well, you've got a point there.[AN]
I've got a bad feeling that he made[N]
it through that mess just fine,[N]
but we can deal with him later.[AN]
For now, let's check outside[N]
and see what's waiting for us.[N]
[Beat]Or more accurately, who.[A][X]

Feels good to be back on steady[N]
land for a change, but damn,[N]
the ship's a complete mess.[AN]
Not sure that Rahel lass can[N]
magic up a fix for this heap.[AN]
[FarLeft]
We won't be flying any time soon,[N]
then. Miss Pilar, you said that[N]
people lived around here, right?[AN]
Do they have a ship that they could[N]
give to us so that we can leave?[A]
[FarRight]
[OQ]Could", sure. Anybody living this[N]
far from Incendivis has the means[N]
to fly. But [OQ]would" is different.[AN]
[Right]
Well, there's only way to find out.[N]
Which way do we go, Pilar?[N]
Let's ask them ourselves.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][2LB]
Any questions that you have[N]
can be directed to me, instead.[AN][X]

What the[Beat] Who are you?[N]
The leader of Pilar's old pals?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If you need a name, we are Keepers[N]
of a forgotten age with no masters,[N]
one Incendivis would like you to forget.[AN]
I suppose I represent our group[N]
more often than not in these matters,[N]
especially when pirates are involved,[AN]
but I do not consider myself or anyone[N]
a leader in the sense that you use it.[N]
We all rule ourselves and no one else.[AN]
[Beat]Pilar, I see you have returned.[N]
What information do you have for me?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Too much to share now, Quispe.[AN]
But for the time being, do you mind[N]
hearing out Lua's requests for aid?[AN]
She's helped me a great deal in my[N]
travels, and I'd see it repaid.[AN]
[R]
Wait, hold on a second here.[N]
You work for this[Beat] Quispe?[N]
What kind of name is that?[AN]
[ML]
In my tongue, a perfectly fine one,[N]
but I wouldn't expect those as ignorant[N]
as you pirates to comprehend this.[AN]
[Beat]Pilar understands my, and my flock's,[N]
vision. Our ideals and hopes align.[AN]
Those being toppling Incendivis,[N]
no matter how difficult the task.[AN]
[R]
The hell? You're a rebel, Pilar?[N]
I knew you had a bone to pick[N]
with the empire, but most pirates do.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]I wasn't exactly subtle, was I?[AN]
My hatred for Incendivis runs deep,[N]
which caused me to leave it behind[N]
years ago and drift into the Old World.[AN]
There, I found this community[N]
of outsiders similar to me.[AN]
A man named Wayra gathered us here[N]
and made us into something more.[AN]
Ever since, I've journeyed outside[N]
the storms to gather information[N]
that we could use to strike back,[AN]
against the empire and its enforcers.[AN]
[R]
You[Beat] So you were just using us to[N]
get by until you could get back here?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]No, I truly enjoyed my time[N]
with the crew. That's why[Beat][AN]
Let me help you get back on your[N]
feet and on your way, Lua.[N]
This is no place for you.[AN]
[ML]
If that is your wish, Pilar,[N]
then so be it. Captain Lua,[N]
was it?[A] I have no love for pirates,[N]
but if you require some assistance,[N]
my flock may be able to help you.[AN]
Whether it be furnishing materials[N]
or manpower to repair your ship,[AN]
or supplying you with provisions[N]
to replace those you have lost,[N]
we have many resources to provide.[AN]
However, my flock has no obligation[N]
to you, and they may request that[N]
you provide them with aid in return.[AN]
Some pirates have ignored my warnings[N]
and tried to steal from our community,[N]
but I wouldn't recommend that path.[AN]
That is, if you wish to keep your lives.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Yeah, like I want to tangle with[N]
you and your wyvern. No thanks, Quispe.[AN]
Tell you what: I'll ask around later[N]
and see who's willing to part[N]
with what we need, and at what cost.[AN]
[FR]
Good. I know the people here well,[N]
so I can guide you around here, Lua.[AN]
For now, though, I have business[N]
to take care of with Quispe.[AN]
You all can stay in any of the empty[N]
lodges in the village up that path.[AN]
Come find me when you're ready,[N]
and I'll help you with any[N]
requests the people give you.[A][X]

Hmph[Beat] I could tell she had a soft[N]
side for rebels, but I hoped that[N]
it was somethin' she did a while ago.[AN]
But this whole time, she was spyin'[N]
for them[Beat] Who knows what she'll[N]
tell those rats about us, boss?[AN]
You sure you wanna let her walk away?[AN]
[MR]
Her allegiance is her business.[N]
[Beat]I'm the one in the wrong,[N]
trusting her despite the signs.[AN]
[FL]
Trusting people isn't wrong, Captain Lua.[AN]
Not ever. I know Miss Pilar isn't who[N]
we thought she was, but even still,[N]
I'm sure she means well for us.[AN]
If she didn't, we never would've[N]
made it this far in the first place.[AN]
[L]
Yeah, you're right, Raz, but[Beat][AN]
I just[Beat] I just can't believe that[N]
once our business is through here,[N]
she's gonna leave us out to dry.[AN]
Like none of the shit we've been[N]
through together mattered[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]
I need to go cool my head, boss.[N][OpenEyes]
Call me if you need anything.[A][CSSCF]
[FL]
I[Beat] I have a hard time imagining[N]
our crew without Miss Pilar, also.[N]
Maybe we can change her mind, captain?[AN]
If she'd listen to anyone on this,[N]
she'd listen to you. I'm sure of it.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]It's her choice to make, Razvan.[N]
I'm not going to bother convincing[N]
someone who doesn't want to be here.[AN]
She's done enough already, showing[N]
us a path out of this mess we're in.[N]
Let's get to walking it and move on.[A][CSSCF]
[FL]
Captain Lua[Beat] Even if you[N]
give up on her, I won't![A][X]

[MidLeft]
So, you're here. Good, good.[N]
Ready to go make the rounds?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Ready as I'll ever be, Pilar.[N]
Fill me in on the details.[AN]
What's with these requests[N]
that Quispe mentioned yesterday?[AN]
[ML]
They're no different from those[N]
you'd find in any other part[N]
of the world. People have problems,[AN]
and some of the problems have no[N]
recourse beyond brute force.[AN]
That's where a roving pirate crew[N]
comes in handy, doesn't it?[AN]
No connections to the community[N]
means no negative effects to it.[AN]
[MR]
In other words, we're hired guns[N]
that are just as good dead as we[N]
are alive, to these Keepers. Wonderful.[AN]
[ML]
As Quispe said, us Keepers have tangled[N]
with pirates before and suffered for it.[AN]
I'm more open-minded than the others,[N]
naturally. I've been one long enough.[AN]
[MR]
A fake one, but whatever you say.[N]
Let's get moving already, Pilar.[AN]
That way, you can get back to your[N]
perfect life here all the sooner.[A][CSSCF]
[ML]
[Beat]You couldn't be further from the truth,[N]
Lua. If Wayra still led the Keepers,[N]
perhaps, but Quispe[Beat] Who knows?[AN]
Since Wayra passed a few months back,[N]
things haven't been the same here.[AN]
[Beat]Old age, they said? We'll see[N]
what I can dig up while I'm here,[N]
and what the truth really is[Beat][A][X]
