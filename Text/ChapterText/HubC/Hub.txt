[MR]
Wait, that's[Beat] Captain Ruby?[AN]
What are you doing in the[N]
Old World, of all places?[A]
[ML]
[ToggleSmile]Missed me, Captain Lua?[N]
It's been a long time.[ToggleSmile][AN]
How's the noble brat[N]
you took off my hands?[A]
[MR]
Hermenegildo? He's made himself[N]
useful in the past few months.[AN]
Turns out he's a halfway[N]
decent swordsman, after all.[A]
[ML]
Now that's a surprise.[AN]
[Beat]But I didn't come here[N]
to banter about the past.[AN]
Lua, I[Beat] need your help.[A]
[MR][1LB]
What? Why?[A]
[ML][2LB]
My Rioja Reapers[Beat] [CloseEyes]picked[N]
a fight we couldn't win.[AN]
Now they're dead, and the force[N]
we were up against remains.[AN]
[OpenEyes]I need it stopped, and soon.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]For her sake.[A]
[MR]
I've never known you to[N]
make this little sense.[AN]
Before I help you with whatever[N]
it is you're planning,[AN]
I need to at least know[N]
the full story first.[A]
[ML]
[OpenEyes]Fine, then. I've nowhere[N]
else to turn to for a hand.[AN]
Do you know the[N]
name Count Sanz?[A]
[MR]
Some Imperial noble with[N]
a reputation as a hoarder.[AN]
My crew actually pulled a[N]
heist on him a while back.[A]
[ML]
His bodyguard, Yurena, is [ToggleSmile]far more[N]
competent than Sanz deserves[ToggleSmile].[AN]
She and I have been chasing each[N]
other around the Empire for years.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]Sure.[A]
[ML][3LB]
We found her and her[N]
wretched boss delving[N]
some ruins near here[Beat][AN]
but Yurena herself was[N]
nowhere to be found,[AN]
and the rest of Sanz's guards[N]
slew my crew to the last.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Lanzarote, my first mate,[N]
clung to life just long[N]
enough to get me here.[AN]
[OpenEyes]I'm looking for revenge, Lua.[N]
That, and a chance to make sure[N]
Yurena didn't die in that pit.[A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I'm sorry for your loss, Ruby.[AN]
I can only imagine what it's like[N]
to lose your whole crew like that.[AN]
[OpenEyes]But the Skysabers are[N]
stranded on this island, too.[AN]
We can't just work for free.[A]
[ML]
Then take the Grapevine. My ship.[AN]
The rebels here say yours isn't[N]
much more than driftwood.[A]
[MR][1LB]
You'd give it away so easily?[A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I've no more crewmates[N]
to sail it with anymore.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Well, Captain Lua? Can you do[N]
this favor for an old friend?[A][X]

[MR]
Hermenegildo? He's dead.[AN]
I let him pick up a sword and[N]
fight alongside my crew[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]all it got the poor[N]
kid was an early grave.[A][OpenEyes]
[ML]
[CloseEyes]That's a damn shame. Hopefully[N]
he was worth his while before then.[AN]

## HubC1Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadRuby]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]
[Beat]We're no friends, Ruby.[N]
But I'll help you anyway.[AN]
Where are these ruins you[N]
want us to check out?[A]
[ML]
An island not far from here,[N]
deeper into the Old World's storm.[AN]
The Grapevine is tough enough[N]
to fly through that weather.[AN]
I'll talk to your navigator[N]
and help them find the path.[A]
[MR]
I'll gather my crew and[N]
meet up aboard your ship.[AN]
We'll depart then.[A]
[ML]
Sounds like a plan.[AN]
[Beat]Though I do have a[N]
question about all this.[AN]
Why are you putting yourself at[N]
this sort of risk for my sake?[A]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]I'd say it's for the[N]
chance at taking your ship,[N]
but that wouldn't be true.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Really, I'm here because of[N]
your story about Yurena.[AN]
[Beat]I know what it's like, to[N]
have someone you care about[N]
disappear with no warning.[AN]
And as a fellow captain,[N]
[OpenEyes]I respect you too much to[N]
let you meet the same fate.[A]
[ML]
[ToggleSmile]Hah. I never took you[N]
to be the caring type.[AN]
But today seems full of[N]
surprises for every one of us.[A][X]

## HubC1Selection_No
[ML][LoadRuby]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I can't take this risk[N]
for your sake, Ruby.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Not as the Skysabers are now.[A]
[ML]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Hah. I figured as much.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Go on then, Lua. Do whatever[N]
else it is you want to do.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I've got nowhere else to go[Beat][A][X]
