[ML][1LB]
Ah! Lua,[.4] have you got a moment?[A]

[MR][2LB]
Sure, not much else to do[N]
but watch the clouds roll here.[A]

[ML][3LB]
We're not too far off of one of[N]
the more substantial towns out[N]
here in this wasteland.[AN]
Perhaps while we're still in a[Beat][N]
somewhat civilised land it might[N]
be worth visiting for trade and supplies.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Is that right Orlando?[AN]
Hm,[.4] I suppose it would be prudent.[AN]
after all who knows how long it'll be[N]
before we see anywhere with real trade again.[AN]
Of course you and I know this is still[N]
quite far out from the usual trade routes.[AN]
They'll probably want to fleece us for[N]
all we're worth especially given our status.[A]

[ML][3LB]
Come now Lua we're both veterans of the[N]
merchants guild,[.4] I'm sure we can[N]
swindle ourselves a good deal.[AN]
Besides it would certainly make for[N]
a good break from all this endless fighting.[A]
