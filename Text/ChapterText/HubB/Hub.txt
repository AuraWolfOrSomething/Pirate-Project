## HubB_BeginningScene_1_1
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
Free and clear, at least for now[Beat][N]
Desiderio, care for another wager?[AN]
[ML]
I'm not fool enough to be fleeced twice.[AN]
Besides, we're not even close to safe,[N]
not with that woman hunting us down.[AN]
I like a good fight, but I'm not messing[N]
with T.O.R.C.H. Not in the open skies.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Relax. We took the only ship on hand,[N]
and there's just as many traps[N]
ready for them on the way out.[AN]
Pitfalls, spearwalls, fireballs[Beat][AN]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]You're a nasty piece of work, boss.[N]
The hunted's really the hunter, huh?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Well, I wouldn't go that far.[N]
Elodia would've never gained notoriety[N]
if obstacles like that stopped her.[AN]
But it'll buy us time, time enough[N]
to pay Port Greagor one last visit.[AN]
I've got a vessel there to reclaim.[A]
[ML]
That bloated boat? Fair enough.[N]
Not like Orlando'll take it off[N]
our hands, since he's one of us.[AN]
[MR]
And we'll need it if our crew gets[N]
any larger. Speaking of, can you[N]
send a signal to that old coot?[AN]
He can keep an eye out for T.O.R.C.H.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Sure, but[Beat] you really trust him?[AN]
You two might go way back, but I've[N]
seen cleaner grime on a tavern floor.[AN]
[MR]
Grime comes with the territory;[N]
no successful merchant is pure.[AN]
That said, the man's helped me through[N]
hard times, long ago and even now.[AN]
If there's anyone I trust, it's him.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Well, if he's good enough for you,[N]
then he's good enough for me.[AN]
And if he's not a very good watchman,[N]
at least Pilar'll have us covered.[AN]
[MR]
Mm. Reliable, as always[Beat][N]
Ah, there's the port now.[AN]
Let's make a quick landing![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_2
[ML][LoadIda]
[R][LoadLua]
[FR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
Well, looks like you finally showed up.[N]
Kept me waiting long enough, Lua.[AN]
[R]
Ida? What are you doing here,[N]
by my boat? Care to explain?[AN]
[FR][3LB]
Probably fixin' to take it for herself.[AN]
She wanted us outta here before T.O.R.C.H.[N]
came knocking, and now, they busted down[N]
our door. Who else gains from all of that?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]If you're trying to accuse me[N]
of calling Incendivis's hunting dogs,[N]
then you're dumber than I thought.[AN]
[FR][2LB]
You want a brawl that bad?[N]
All you had to do was ask![AN]
[R][3LB]
Desiderio, cool it![AN]
There's no proof that someone who's[N]
helped us all this time would turn,[N]
right? Take a step back and think.[AN]
We've made plenty of enemies who'd[N]
relish a chance to take us down.[A]
[FR][2LB]
[Beat]Pah. Fine, I'll shut it.[AN]
We've got no time to waste, anyway.[N]
Let's just get this thing flying.[AN]
[ML]
If that's what you want, you should[N]
be thanking me. It's already running.[AN]
[R]
Really? My thanks, but[Beat][N]
How did you know we were coming?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I didn't, but some suspicious characters[N]
kept roving around the port. Pirates,[N]
I'd bet, but no flags to prove it.[AN]
One of my men told me as much,[N]
and that it kept getting worse,[N]
so I came down and chased them off.[AN]
Made me figure something was coming[N]
for your crew, so I did you a favor,[N]
figuring you wouldn't leave the ship.[AN]
Call it a reward for being a good[N]
customer. And as I say that[Beat][N]
Where's Rahel? She was with you.[A]
[R][2LB]
She's safe, just below board.[N]
Rahel! Ida's here![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_3
[ML][LoadIda]
[MR][LoadRahel]
[ML]
So[Beat] that's the situation, is it?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
I'm[Beat] I'm sorry, Master Ida.[AN]
The moment my horse came running to me,[N]
and their commanders saw me there[Beat][AN]
Between reasoning with T.O.R.C.H.[N]
and fighting my way out of there,[N]
I took my chances with the second one.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Here's a better option: stay out of it.[AN]
Not like the captain is relying on you,[N]
girl. You're not much of a fighter.[AN]
[MR]
'Course, but I[Beat] I couldn't run.[AN]
They'd seen me already, so hiding[N]
wouldn't have done any good.[N]
[Beat]What should I do, Master Ida?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You'll have a bounty drawn up soon,[N]
I'm sure, so you can't stay here.[AN]
Ha! A girl like you, with doubloons[N]
on her head[Beat] All for surviving,[N]
in a bad position that I put you in.[AN]
It shouldn't have come to that.[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes][1LB]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[ML][3LB]
Well, here's your reward, at least.[AN]
Those doubloons should last you[N]
a while, if you're frugal.[N]
[Beat]As for what you should do?[AN]
You can make your own decisions,[N]
but if you've got no other plans,[N]
then why not join Lua's crew?[AN]
[MR][OpenEyes][2LB]
But[Beat] but that doesn't make sense![AN]
All this time, I've been training[N]
to become like you, Master Ida![AN]
And now, you're saying I should[N]
go follow a damned pirate?[AN]
After everything I've learned?[N]
With all I have left to do here?![AN]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Listen to me, because I'll only[N]
say it once. You'll never be me.[AN]
As long as you're chasing my shadow,[N]
following me like a baby chick,[N]
you'll never even get close.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
But I[Beat] I still have so much to repay[N]
you for. I can't just leave, can I?[N]
[ML][3LB]
Whatever you think you owe me,[N]
save it. I took you in because[N]
you had nowhere else to go,[AN]
not because I expected a return.[AN]
[Beat]There's a wide world in these skies,[N]
one you haven't seen a bit of.[AN]
Find your own dream out there,[N]
instead of chasing after mine.[AN]
[MR]
I[Beat] Fine![A] If you don't want me here,[N]
then I'm gone. There's nothing for me[N]
in this shoddy port, anyway![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_4
[ML][LoadIda][ToggleSmile][3LB]
Maybe I was too hard on her.[N]
She needed to hear it, but[Beat][N]
It's tough seeing her tear up.[AN][MR][LoadLua][ML]
[Beat]Lua, what do you want?[N]
You should be ready to go.[A]
[MR][LoadLua]
I just wanted to say thanks,[N]
for everything you've done these[N]
past few months to help my crew.[AN]
I'm not sure that I can ever pay[N]
it back to you, but I'll try.[N]
If there's anything I can do, then-[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Yeah. There is one thing you can do,[N]
that only you can do for me, Lua.[AN]
Frankly, whatever happens to Ponte,[N]
I won't hold you accountable for.[AN]
But Rahel[Beat] I've watched her grow up.[N]
I got her into this mess, and I need[N]
you to keep her safe til it blows over.[AN]
If you do that, then we're square.[N]
I'm[Beat] I'm counting on you.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat] Of course, Ida.[N]
I won't let you down.[AN]
You'll see her again,[N]
on my word as her captain![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_5
[ML][LoadRahel]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]
[Beat]What do you want?[AN]
[MR]
Just checking in on you.[AN]
You're part of my crew now,[N]
so it's kind of my job.[AN]
[ML]
Whatever.[N]
Are we leaving or not?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]Look, Rahel. I know you feel[N]
like you've lost a lot today,[N]
and you lashed out back there.[AN]
But don't let those be the last[N]
words you say to Ida, hear me?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
What? That's none of your business.[N]
I can say whatever I want.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Yes, but you'd better be willing[N]
to live with it, no matter what.[AN]
If you never see her again,[N]
is that what you want her to remember?[AN]
As a kid, I bounced around orphanages,[N]
never staying at one for very long,[N]
so I never cared about someone like that.[AN]
But if I did, I wouldn't want this to[N]
be the last memory I had of them.[AN]
[Beat]Well, we're taking off right now,[N]
so whatever you decide, make it quick.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML]
[Beat] [Beat][N]
Damn it, I hope she doesn't hear me.[AN][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_6
[FR][LoadRahel]
Master Ida![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadIda]
Rahel? I thought you were setting sail.[N]
Are you sure you have time for this?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FR][LoadRahel]
O-Of course I do![N]
I[Beat] I[Beat][AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadIda]
[Beat]Keep your feet steady, alright?[N]
You've got to watch out for yourself,[N]
now. I won't be there to do it for you.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FR][LoadRahel]
I know that! I[Beat] I wanted to thank you.[N]
I'd be dead in a ditch without you[N]
taking me under your wing, Master Ida.[AN]
If you won't let me repay you,[N]
then all I can do is make you proud.[AN]
[Beat]That's all I wanted to say.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadRahel]
Goodbye, Master Ida[Beat][N]
I'll never forget you![A][X]

// Scene 2
// She promises to pay him all he's worth once she finds what she's searching for, at the end of the world.
// He cheerily agrees to this, and Pilar muses at her deflection working until she realizes Lua is serious. 

## HubB_BeginningScene_2_1
[L][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]
Ah, Pilar.[N]
How do the skies look?[AN]
They
[L]
Free of pursuers.[AN]
[MR]
Excellent. Anything else to report?[N]
Good news, bad news, I want it all.[AN]
[L]
Well[Beat] There is one thing.[N]
Come in, stowaway. You're wanted.[AN]
[FL][LoadPonte]
Oh boy, I am?[N]
I'm not used to this![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Stowaway?[N]
Wait, from which boat?[AN]
[L]
The merchant ship. I found him[N]
hiding, poorly, behind a barrel.[AN]
[MR]
Well, out with it before[N]
I throw you overboard.[AN]
What's your business on my ship?[AN]
[FL]
Y-Yes, ma'am! The name's Ponte,[N]
and I wanna join your crew![AN]
I'm a real good carpenter,[N]
even better than Rahel![AN]
[MR]
I don't necessarily doubt you, but[Beat][N]
Are you carrying a massive ladder?[AN]
First, how, and more importantly, why?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Hm? Well, I've always been built[N]
like a sky ox! And I figure,[N]
it's real nice to have a path.[AN]
I can make this and put it down[N]
anywhere, long as I'm paid for it![AN]
[MR]
I[Beat] suppose I can see use in that,[N]
but what about your character?[AN]
Why do you want to become a pirate?[AN]
[FL]
Er, well[Beat] To tell ya the truth,[N]
I've got a rough background.[AN]
Piratin' ain't much to me,[N]
compared to where I've been.[AN]
But Master Ida saw somethin'[N]
in me and took me under her wing![AN]
I thought I'd be the next big shipwright[N]
'round port, but she told me that[N]
y'all were looking for more help.[AN]
Also, that you had a lotta gold[Beat][N]
So here I am! What's our next stop?[AN]
[MR]
Hm[Beat] You seem like an unimpressive[N]
fighter, but your[Beat] unique set[N]
of skills may prove useful to us.[AN]
I'll pay you resource costs for any[N]
services done, but the bulk of your[N]
payment will have to wait, Ponte.[AN]
I'm expecting a great windfall,[N]
waiting for us in the Old World.[AN]
A vast collection of treasure[Beat][N]
You'll be the first one I pay.[AN]
[FL]
Wow, really? That's real kind of you.[N]
I accept, Captain Lua![AN]
It's a pleasure doin' business with ya![A][X]

// Scene 3
// Pilar asks when she planned on telling the rest of them.
// Lua responds that with all respect, it's her business, so she was approaching it at her own pace. 
// Pilar tells her that her personal life stopped being her business the moment she called herself a captain.
// They're a crew, and their captain's goal affects the future of all of her crew. Especially if it means venturing into the Old World,
// where the security of well-mapped lands no longer exists, and all that saves you from ruin is luck.
// Lua comments on how her opinion sounds surprisingly well-informed, almost as if she's been there before; Pilar says nothing.
// Lua exhales, and tells Pilar to gather the crew. She'll announce her goals, and the rest of them can make their own decision on hearing it.
// Pilar 

// The entire crew congregates in the mess hall, with Lua at the helm. She tells them that for now, they're safe, and that means they need to decide on a path forward.
// Lua tells the crew that she intends to keep flying deeper into the outskirts, but she wants to hear their opinions.
// Razvan goes first, agreeing that they should keep flying to the outskirts and keep out of the empire's path.
// He reasons that this is easier where they're headed, since there are few imperial outposts.
// However, he mourns the lawlessness of some parts, ruled by pirates.
// Desiderio cuts in, saying he prefers it to the stiff arm of the law waiting for them the other way.
// Desiderio also remarks on the increasing rebel activity as they head in, saying that he has a score to settle with an old acquaintance.
// Since they're in this area, he's got plenty of reason to keep flying with Lua.
// Pilar seems to think of responding, but simply says that she has no objections.
// She also tells Lua that the false security of the empire that constrained her will still be present, unless they head even further into the unknown.
// Lua pauses and then continues that according to Orlando's reports, there are a greater number of marines in the area than usual.
// Although she doubted at first, she believes now that they are searching for something[Beat] something valuable, that she wants to take from under their noses.
// She tells the crew that this may even lead them into the unknown that Pilar speaks of, and says that if they have any objections to that, to say them now.
// Each of the crew collected so far say their piece; Orlando and Rahel start, the rest of the crew (if alive), and lastly, the main 3.
// They all agree to go along with Lua's goal, and Lua, heartened by their response, then tells them that this is the formation of a proper crew, with a real goal.
// She says that any proper crew deserves a proper name, and she gives them one: The Freeblades.
// Lua then tells them it's time to spend some of Ignacio's plentiful stores for a grand feast. The crew cheers and chants their new name, then the scene ends.

(Ahhhh[Beat] It feels like the post-feast[N]
hangover has finally worn off for me.[AN]
And hopefully, the actual hangovers[N]
some others have faded away, too.[AN]
It's about time to begin scouting[N]
for any points of interest out here.[AN]
I doubt we'll find any Fire Emblem[N]
while we're still in charted lands,[AN]

[ML][1LB]
Captain. Do you have a moment?[A]
[MR][2LB]
We've no shortage of time[N]
out here. Say your piece.[A]
[ML][3LB]
With how big the armada's gotten,[N]
our supplies just can't keep up.[A][N]
I know Pilar has a plan[N]
to get us some fresh water,[A][N]
but all the water in the sky[N]
can't take the place of a[N]
hearty meal or sturdy hull.[A]
[MR][2LB]
That's a problem, all right.[A][N]
And with our scale, we'll need to[N]
find a proper port to restock[Beat][A][N]
but out here?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]I've already been looking into it.[A][N]
Asked Pilar for some help.[A][N]
And she found a place not far[N]
from here called Port Receloso.[A]
[MR]
A port all the way on the[N]
outskirts of the Empire[Beat][A][N]
It'd have to be quiet, at least.[A]
[ML]
A quiet frontier port? I[N]
think you mean [OpenQuote]too" quiet.[A][N]
No way somewhere out here[N]
is as safe as it looks.[A]

[ML][3LB]
We're not too far off of one of[N]
the more substantial towns out[N]
here in this wasteland.[AN]
Perhaps while we're still in a[Beat][N]

Hm,[.4] I suppose it would be prudent.[AN]
after all who knows how long it'll be[N]
before we see anywhere with real trade again.[AN]
Of course you and I know this is still[N]
quite far out from the usual trade routes.[AN]
They'll probably want to fleece us for[N]

[ML][3LB]
Come now Lua we're both veterans of the[N]
