Captain. Do you have a moment?[A]
[MR][2LB]
We've no shortage of time[N]
out here. Say your piece.[A]
[ML][3LB]
With how big the armada's gotten,[N]
our supplies just can't keep up.[A][N]
I know Pilar has a plan[N]
to get us some fresh water,[A][N]
but all the water in the sky[N]
can't take the place of a[N]
hearty meal or sturdy hull.[A]
[MR][2LB]
That's a problem, all right.[A][N]
And with our scale, we'll need to[N]
find a proper port to restock[Beat][A][N]
but out here?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]I've already been looking into it.[A][N]
Asked Pilar for some help.[A][N]
And she found a place not far[N]
from here called Port Receloso.[A]
[MR]
A port all the way on the[N]
outskirts of the Empire[Beat][A][N]
It'd have to be quiet, at least.[A]
[ML]
A quiet frontier port? I[N]
think you mean [OpenQuote]too" quiet.[A][N]
No way somewhere out here[N]
is as safe as it looks.[A]
[MR]
So if we go there,[AN]
we'd definitely need to[N]
prepare for trouble[Beat][A][X]

If TORCH is still following us,[N]
they'd expect us to land at[N]

And our stocks should be able to[N]
hold out for a bit longer[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]

be there when we need it.[A][X]
