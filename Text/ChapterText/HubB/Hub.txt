// Hub B Script

// Scene 1
// Having fleed from Elodia's trap, Lua and the gang fly with their newly acquired ship with a sense of purpose.
// First, they stop by the port one last time to see if they can safely acquire their third ship before T.O.R.C.H comes to catch them.
// They are surprised to find Ida there readying their ship for takeoff, and Lua initially believes she's taking it for herself.
// Ida tells her off and lets her know that she saw some suspicious characters (pirates) around the boatyard, which Ida chased off.
// This led her to believe that trouble was coming for Lua's crew, but she believed that she'd make her way out of it anyway.
// So, she got their ship ready and waited, planning to turn Lua in on the spot if she didn't keep Rahel safe.
// Rahel apologizes to Ida, saying she had to defend herself against T.O.R.C.H, and that she'd bring shame to Ida's name if she stayed.
// Ida at first moves to admonish her, but she instead comforts Rahel, telling her that her surviving means more than anything else.
// She tells Rahel to travel with Lua's crew and see the world, as she's spent long enough milling about the port following after her shadow.
// Rahel tentatively agrees, but tells Ida she'll come right back to take over the guild once it's all blown over, since Ida's too old for that.
// Ida starts to chew her out, but Lua thanks her for all the help she's given her and her crew over the last few months they've haunted Port Greagor.
// She then says that they really have to go before "The Pirate Hunter" pursues them. Rahel and Ida share a heartfelt goodbye (think Sanji and Zeff).
// As Rahel tears up on the deck, she tells Lua that this all better be worth what she's lost; Lua assures her that it will be.

// Scene 2
// A couple days pass, and Pilar informs Lua that there's no sign of pursuers following them. Lua exhales, and tells Pilar to gather the crew.

Captain. Do you have a moment?[A]
[MR][2LB]
We've no shortage of time[N]
out here. Say your piece.[A]
[ML][3LB]
With how big the armada's gotten,[N]
our supplies just can't keep up.[A][N]
I know Pilar has a plan[N]
to get us some fresh water,[A][N]
but all the water in the sky[N]
can't take the place of a[N]
hearty meal or sturdy hull.[A]
[MR][2LB]
That's a problem, all right.[A][N]
And with our scale, we'll need to[N]
find a proper port to restock[Beat][A][N]
but out here?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]I've already been looking into it.[A][N]
Asked Pilar for some help.[A][N]
And she found a place not far[N]
from here called Port Receloso.[A]
[MR]
A port all the way on the[N]
outskirts of the Empire[Beat][A][N]
It'd have to be quiet, at least.[A]
[ML]
A quiet frontier port? I[N]
think you mean [OpenQuote]too" quiet.[A][N]
No way somewhere out here[N]
is as safe as it looks.[A]
[MR]
So if we go there,[AN]
we'd definitely need to[N]
prepare for trouble[Beat][A][X]

[ML][1LB]
Ah! Lua,[.4] have you got a moment?[A]

[MR][2LB]
Sure, not much else to do[N]
but watch the clouds roll here.[A]

[ML][3LB]
We're not too far off of one of[N]
the more substantial towns out[N]
here in this wasteland.[AN]
Perhaps while we're still in a[Beat][N]
somewhat civilised land it might[N]
be worth visiting for trade and supplies.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Is that right Orlando?[AN]
Hm,[.4] I suppose it would be prudent.[AN]
after all who knows how long it'll be[N]
before we see anywhere with real trade again.[AN]
Of course you and I know this is still[N]
quite far out from the usual trade routes.[AN]
They'll probably want to fleece us for[N]
all we're worth especially given our status.[A]

[ML][3LB]
Come now Lua we're both veterans of the[N]
merchants guild,[.4] I'm sure we can[N]
swindle ourselves a good deal.[AN]
Besides it would certainly make for[N]
a good break from all this endless fighting.[A]

Hmm[Beat] I suppose so.[X]

Alright Orlando you made your case.[A]
We could do with something less[Beat] Intensive[N]
