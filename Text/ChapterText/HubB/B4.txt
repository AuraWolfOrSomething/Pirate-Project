Finally,[.4] I can see the gates.[A]

[L][2LB]
That's the annoying thing about inland towns,[.4][N]
can't just park right in the middle.[A]

[FL][3LB]
Yes well, either way we're here now.[.4][N]
Best look presentable and try and act[N]
like we aren't pirates on the run.[A]

[R][2LB]
Say don't you think it looks a bit quiet[N]
there? No guards stationed or anything.[A]

Could this day go any more wrong?[.4][N]
We'll just have to finish and[N]
