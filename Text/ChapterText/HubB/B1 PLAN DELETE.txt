Questgiver: Razvan

Scenario:
A treasure ruin puppeted by bandits called the antlions where they lure in travelers with myths of a dangerous treasure.
They meet a local called Dmitr who offers to guide them to the treasure.
They arrive and find the Antlions lying in wait.
Potentially the ruins are going to collapse.

Scene 1:

Lua bumps into razvan on the boat who talks about a large desert on one of the islands out here
He suggests trying to map it, its inhospitable conditions might make it a place where they could find some useful treasure.

Scene 2:
They arrive in a small village that seems a good place to stay the night and scout information.
In a tavern they hear travellers talking about the treasure but people don't want to take them
Dmitr overhears them and offers to guide them and they set off in the morning.
Flying into the desert is considered a bad idea due to sandstorms that may ruin the boat

Scene 3:
They've been travelling a while and find the ruins, however they also find the antlions!


Ending Scene:
Depending on how much loot was secured they get a different ending scene and it ends in an 'oh gods we have to walk all the way back'
